#PLOTS - note that the filepaths may need adjustment to run any of this code on your machine

Figure 1 is a conceptual figure, we do not provide code to recreate it.

To remake Figure 2, run the code in DiscordanceNullPower.R

To remake Figures 3 and 4, run the code in NullandEmpRDist.R

To remake Figure 5, run the code in Fig5Updated.R

Numerous other scripts are included in this folder that did not get included in the final manuscript, but may include some analyses of interest to some users.

In general you may need to change some filepaths to adjust for the local structure of your filesystem and/or the location of your home directory.
Hopefully this is typically clear based on the error messages you will receive, but you are welcome to contact us if we can be helpful in any way.
