#CODE
This software implements analyses in Louw et al 2023.

The code requires DendroPy to run most of the analyses: https://dendropy.org/

The source code is available in the src folder. You can install it by running "python setup.py install --user" from the command line.

Once you've installed the source, the code in the scripts folder implements the analyses in the figures. The visualizations were made using ggplot and code for these is available in the conceptPlot folder. To rerun all the analyses, uncomment the lines in scripts/run_disc_sims.sh and rerun all the code. Note that this is not gauranteed to work without some modification as the filepaths to some of the data may be different on your machine. 

#DATA
Gene tree files are stored in obsData/Gene_Trees

Sequence data is available in obsData/Single_Copy_Orthologue_Sequences

Output from FungiFun v.2 (tests for pathway enrichment) is available in enrichOut in CSV format. 

RCC values (competitive index) are available in obsData/RCCdata.txt. The three distinct numbers per species pair represent experimental replicates. We averaged the three replicates per pair for analyses in our study.

Orthologs have ID numbers in the file names that correspond to the Orthogroup/Gene numbers in Tables 1 and S1 in our manuscript. The Gene ID numbers 
in Table S4 correspond to the IDs in the Penicillium chrysogenum reference genome (taxonomy ID 500485), available at uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=(taxonomy_id:500485). 

#PLOTS - note that the filepaths may need adjustment to run any of this code on your machine

Figure 1 is a conceptual figure, we do not provide code to recreate it.

To remake Figure 2, run the code in conceptPlot/DiscordanceNullPower.R

To remake Figures 3 and 4, run the code in conceptPlot/NullandEmpRDist.R

To remake Figure 5, run the code in conceptPlot/CorrGeneOfInt.R
